         <h2>Introduction</h2>
         <p>Java refers to a number of computer software products and specifications from Sun Microsystems
            (the Java™ technology) that together provide a system for developing and deploying cross-platform
            applications.</p>
            <h2>OOP  Object Oriented Programming</h2>
            <p>When speaking about OOP one has to mention:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Inheritance
                    </li>
                <li>Modularity
                    </li>
                <li>Polymorphism
                    </li>
                <li>Encapsulation (binding code and its data)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Data Abstraction</h3>
            <p>Humans manage
                complexity through abstraction. For example, people do not think of a car as a set ofte ns of
                thousands of individual parts. They think of it as a well-defined object with its own unique
                behavior. This abstraction allows people to use a car to drive to the grocery store without being
                overwhelmed by the complexity of the parts that form the car. They can ignore the details of how
                the engine, transmission, and braking systems work. Instead they are free to utilize the object as
                a whole.
                A powerful way to manage abstraction is through the use of hierarchical classifications.
                This allows you to layer the semantics of complex systems, breaking them into more manageable
                pieces. From the outside, the car is a single object.</p>
                <h3>Encapsulation</h3>
                <p>An object encapsulates the methods and data that are contained inside it .the rest of the system
                    interacts with an object only through a well defined set of services that it provides</p>

                <h2>CLASSES AND OBJECTS</h2>
                <h3>Concepts of classes and objects:</h3>
                <p> a class is a template for an object, and an object is an instance of a class. Because
                    an object is an instance of a class, you will often see the two words object and instance used
                    interchangeably</p>
                    <h3>The General Form of a Class</h3>
                    <p>When you define a class, you declare its exact form and nature. You do this by specifying
                        the data that it contains and the code that operates on that data.
                        A class is declared by use of the class keyword. The classes that have been used up to
                        this point are actually very limited examples of its complete form. Classes can (and usually do)
                        get much more complex. The general form of a class definition is shown here:</p>
                         <div>class classname { <br>
                            type instance- <br>
                            variable1; type <br>
                            instance-variable2; <span>// ... </span><br>
                            type instance-variableN; <br>
                            type methodname1(parameter-list) { <br>
                            <span>// body of method </span><br>
                            }<br>
                            type methodname2(parameter-list) {<br>
                            <span>// body of method</span><br>
                            }<br>
                            <span>// ...</span><br>
                            type methodnameN(parameter-list) {<br>
                            <span>// body of method</span><br>
                            }<br>
                        }<br></div>
                        <p>
                            The data, or variables, defined within a class are called instance variables. The code is
                            contained within methods. Collectively, the methods and variables defined within a class are
                            called members of the class. In most classes, the instance variables are acted upon and accessed
                            by the methods defined for that class. Thus, it is the methods that de can be used.</p>
                            <h3>Declaring Objects</h3>
                            <div>Ex: Box mybox = new Box();<br>
                            Box mybox; <span>// declare reference to object</span> <br>
                            mybox = new Box(); <span>// allocate a Box object</span> <br></div>
                            <h3>My first Java program</h3>
                            <p>public class Example1{</p>
                                <div>public static void main (String args []) {
   System.out.println ("My first Java program"); <br>
}} <br></div>
<h2>Variables and Data Types</h2>
<h3>Variables</h3>
<p>A variable is a place where the program stores data temporarily. As the name implies the value
stored in such a location can be changed while a program is executing (compare with constant).</p>
class Example2 { <br>
                                <div>    public static void main(String args[]) { <br>
                                        int var1; <span>// this declares a variable </span><br>
                                        int var2; <span>// this declares another variable </span><br>
                                        var1 = 1024; <span>// this assigns 1024 to var1</span> <br>
                                        System.out.println("var1 contains " + var1); <br>
                                        var2 = var1 / 2; <br>
                                        System.out.print("var2 contains var1 / 2: "); <br>
                                        System.out.println(var2); <br>
                                        } <br>
                                        } <br> </div>
                                        <p>Predicted Output:</p>
                                        <p>var2 contains var1 / 2: 512</p>

    <p>The Boolean data type can be either TRUE or FALSE. It can be useful when controlling flow of a
        program by assigning the Boolean data type to variables which function as flags. Thus program flow
        would depend on the condition of these variables at the particular instance. Remember that the
        output of a condition is always Boolean</p>

<h2>Scope and Lifetime of Variables</h2>
<p>The following simple programs, illustrate how to avoid programming errors by taking care where to
    initialize variables depending on the scope.</p>
    class Example16 { <br>
        <div>
        public static void main(String args[]) { <br>
        int x; // known to all code within main <br>
        x = 10; <br>
        if(x == 10) { <span>// start new scope</span> <br>
        int y = 20; <span>// known only to this block </span><br>
        <span>// x and y both known here.</span> <br>
        System.out.println("x and y: " + x + " " + y); <br>
        x = y * 2; <br>
        } <br>
        <span>// y = 100; // Error! y not known here </span><br>
        <span>// x is still known here.</span> <br>
        System.out.println("x is " + x); <br>
    } } <br> </div>
<p>Predicted Output: <br>
    <b>x and y: 10 20</b> <br>
    <b>x is 40</b></p>
